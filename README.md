## README file:

This project is a simple terminal app (with some bash scripts) that based on input will give you information from the https://xchain.io blockchain - Counterparty Blockchain (XCP token). As someone who used that blockchain and website I've found the tools to find certain information not sufficient so I decided to code something up to remedy it.

I've focused on dispenses from a certain address. By entering the address you will get a .csv file that contains most of the interesting information (will be customizable in the future) about the dispense. Some more work is needed to clean the data and perhaps visualise the trends for specific assets, but at the very least the program is working.
